# statustimers for Ashita v4

This addon provides a configurable replacement for the in-game status icons in FFXI for use with Ashita v4.

Currently supported customizations:

- icon size
- icon theme
- font
- font size
- font colour
- number of item rows (defaults to 2 rows x 16 items)
- position

To change any of these settings make sure statustimers in unloaded, then edit _config/statustimers.ini_.
To visually change the position hold down shift and drag statustimers to the desired screen position.
The updated location will be stored automatically.

In addition to these appearance options there's als a "visual aid" mode which will add a coloured bar
below each status effect indicating it's remaining duration visually as green/yellow/orange/red/red flashing.

#### theming support

statustimers supports custom (non DAT) themes, for details see _addons/statustimers/themes/README.md_

#### TODO:

- add support to specify source icon size for themes
